            Technology is in my soul, it has been my main source of joy and knowledge in the past four years. In 2023 I decided to ingress into the computing course at <a href="https://ifc.edu.br">IFC</a>. I had the idea to make CodeCrafters for a WebDesign work, while it would fit the work, it would be a good place to share all projects we make during the course. I hope you have fun while surfing through our projects.

            I like to keep minimalism as a noticeable characteristic of my work, while not puting away functionality and visual pleasure. I love everything from the frontend to the backend and hardware, even though I like being able to do everything by myself, knowing how to do things together with other people is a virtue that gets even more important as projecs scale, that's why I'll always try to share my projects with someone.
        </p>
        <p>All my projects are open-source, I think that transparency is the key for trust while sharing those projects with the world, feel free to access my GitHub profile and check the source-code of anything listed here.</p>
